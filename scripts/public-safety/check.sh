# check.sh — this repository's public-safety gate
# ==============================================================================
# Usage: OSE_GATE_SURFACE=<surface> scripts/public-safety/check.sh [hook args]
#
#   commit-msg   $1 is the file holding the message being written
#   pre-commit   no arguments; the staged tree is the subject
#   pre-push     ref updates arrive on stdin, as Git supplies them
#   ci           no arguments; the checked-out tree is the subject
#
# The surface arrives in the environment and nowhere else. It is never inferred
# from an argument's filename, from which hook happens to be running, or from
# whether a remote is reachable — a gate that guesses its own surface will
# eventually guess a weaker one, and that is precisely the case where guessing
# is expensive.
#
# This file decides *what is outbound* at each surface. `outbound-preflight.sh`
# decides whether any of it is prohibited. Keeping those apart is what lets the
# leaf be tested against synthetic inputs with no repository at all.
#
# Exit codes pass through from the leaf: 0 clean, 1 blocked, 2 scan error.
