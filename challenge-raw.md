# Challenge (Raw)

The assessment brief this repository answers, with its wording kept exactly as received. Each line of the original is
its own paragraph here, and long lines are wrapped to 120 columns; no word, number, or punctuation mark was changed, so
run-together sentences and missing spaces are the source's own. Every other document cites this file rather than
restating the brief.

Staff Software Engineer — In-Memory Account Ledger Core

You have 48 hours. Budget roughly 1–2 hours of design thinking, 2 hours of building, and the rest for documentation. AI
tools are permitted and expected. The submitted artifacts are your entry ticket; a 45-minute live defense with no AI
present is the assessment.

1. In-Memory Account Ledger Core

Build

An in-memory account ledger core. Any language. No web layer, no persistence, no UI, no database. It must be exercised
by a runnable test suite or script that replays the event stream and prints, per day: closing ledger balance, fee
assessments, authorization states, and errors.

The window is six days, Day 1 through Day 6.

Accounts:- ACC-001 — AED, opening balance 0.00

ACC-002 — BHD, opening balance 0.000Non-negotiable rules:Overdraft fee: AED 25.00, assessed once per day per account
when that day's closing ledger balance (all entries with value_date ≤ that day) is negative. Booked with value_date
equal to the day assessed.Daily interest: 0.04% per day on the closing ledger balance, positive balances only. Accruals
capitalize as a single credit at end of Day 6. The rounded daily accruals must sum exactly to the capitalized total.AED
is 2 decimal places, BHD is 3. Amounts stored and rounded to their own precision.The ledger is append-only. No event
record is ever mutated or deleted.An authorization is approved only if the account's available balance — ledger balance
minus active holds — remains at or above zero after the hold is applied.Event stream, replayed in this order:

#Booked Event Details - E1 — Day 1 — CREDIT — ACC-001 AED 1,200.00 — value_date Day 1

E2 — Day 1 — DEBIT — ACC-001 AED 950.00 — value_date Day 1

E3 — Day 2 — AUTHORIZATION — ACC-001 Auth-A hold AED 200.00 — value_date Day 2

E4 — Day 3 — CREDIT — ACC-001 AED 400.00 — value_date Day 3

E5 — Day 4 — SETTLEMENT — ACC-001 Auth-A settles for AED 185.00 — value_date Day 4

E6 — Day 4 — SETTLEMENT — ACC-001 Auth-Z settles for AED 180.00 — value_date Day 4 (Auth-Z has no preceding
authorization event)

E7 — Day 5 — DEBIT — ACC-001 AED 620.00 — value_date Day 2

E8 — Day 5 — AUTHORIZATION — ACC-001 Auth-B hold AED 90.00 — value_date Day 5

E9 — Day 6 — REVERSAL — ACC-001 reverses E7 — value_date Day 2

E10 — Day 5 — CREDIT — ACC-002 BHD 10.000, posted as three equal instalments — value_date Day 5Auth-B is never settled
inside the window.

Acceptance criteria

Some of the following criteria are wrong. Identify every incorrect criterion, refuse it, and document your reasoning in
REJECTED.md.The Day 2 closing ledger balance, evaluated at end of Day 5 and before any fee is assessed, is AED
−370.00.E7 causes exactly one overdraft fee to be assessed, on Day 2.The Day 4 settlement of Auth-A must be accepted.Any
settlement referencing an authorization ID not present in the ledger must be rejected and the funds must not leave the
account.If Auth-B is approved, its hold reduces available balance but not ledger balance.After E9, all balances and fees
return to their pre-E7 values.The three BHD instalments in E10 must each be BHD 3.334.If the rounded daily interest
accruals do not sum to the capitalized total, the remainder is discarded.Deliverable 1 — repository

Intact commit history, no squashing. Plus:- README — how to run the suite and read the output

NUMBERS.md — every constant you chose, why that value and not half it

AMBIGUITIES.md — every ambiguity you found and how you resolved it; near-empty is a fail

REJECTED.md — criteria refused with reasons, plus approaches abandoned mid-build

One failing test against your own design, inline-annotated with what it reveals

WORKLOG.md — timestamped, real

2. Architecture & Trade-offs Document

Write a concise document covering the architectural decisions, trade-offs, and production considerations arising
directly from your ledger implementation.

Required sections:

Append-only at scale. What breaks first at 100× volume? Where does your design accumulate unbounded state, and what is
the cheapest structural change that defers that problem?

Value-dated entries in production. Describe the operational and regulatory surface that value-dated entries create in a
UAE-licensed bank, and name one control you would add before going live.

Authorization lifecycle. State every way an authorization in your model can end other than a matching settlement. For
each, the real-world scenario it represents and the system behavior you would mandate.

What you cut and why. Every simplification made to stay in scope, and the production risk each one defers.

Do not restate the event stream or reproduce rule text from Part 1.

HOW YOU'LL BE EVALUATED

Candidates are evaluated primarily on the live defense: every number and design decision must be explained precisely and
without AI assistance. The written artifacts are assessed for intellectual honesty (AMBIGUITIES.md, REJECTED.md),
correctness of the event replay and fee logic, and the quality of trade-off reasoning in the architecture document — not
for code volume or polish.
